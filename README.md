The search application searches for all files that contains a specified string under the current directory

The application is written using the JavaScript programming language. 

The application should be executed under the NodeJS platform. 

For example, when the user executes the following command: C:\MyFolder >node search.js txt Ori

The application searches for all files with the extension txt under C:\MyFolder (including
subdirectories) that contain the string Ori. Once the search completes, the application displays the list
of all matching files
